## Neural Networks from Scratch with Python from  the youtube channel [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ)

"The goal is to break it down so much that it is panfully simple "


## Introduction: 
The purpuse is to know how neural networks works at a very deep level, because trying to solve more complex problems is gonna require a deep understand of how things actually work.
